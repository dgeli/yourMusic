Project that consumes services exposed by Spotify to consult artists and their albums.


## Token creation for use of Spotify services

To use Spotify services, a token must be generated as follows:
	-Create an account on SpotiFyForDevelopers: https://developer.spotify.com/
	-Go to Dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications
	-Enter the created app and copy the two IDs that Spotify provides for it: 
		.Client Id
		.Client Secret
	- Go to Authentization Guide: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/
	     Choose a means of authorization for example the following: Client Credentials Flow
		 This method defines that we should do the following:
			-Run the service: POST - https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token sending the following keys:
					KEY             VALUE
					grant_type		client_credentials
					client_id		<client Id de la app>
					client_secret	<client Secret de la app>
			-The service will return the token as shown below:
			{
				"access_token": "BQAuaQROwK9fJDbvzW6Nls5bQfMlvWIDa858PoPN9ihCxUyunLITsxAabkvDi9tmE8jZOeHsp79opaSwsg0",
				"token_type": "Bearer",
				"expires_in": 3600
			}
	-Once the token is obtained, it must be replaced in the code service located in \src\app\services: music.services.ts:
		    const headers = new HttpHeaders({
				Authorization: 'Bearer BQAuaQROwK9fJDbvzW6Nls5bQfMlvWIDa858PoPN9ihCxUyunLITsxAabkvDi9tmE8jZOeHsp79opaSwsg0',
			});
	NOTE: The token lasts only 1 hour, after that it must be regenerated by running the https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token service again with the corresponding keys.
	
	
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
